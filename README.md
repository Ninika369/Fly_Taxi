## Overview

FlyTaxi is a full-fledged ride-hailing system that includes services for passengers, drivers, and administrators. The project uses a **microservices architecture** to ensure scalability, with an emphasis on real-world functionalities like **ride estimation**, **real-time driver/passenger matching**, and **payment integration**. This project serves as both a technical showcase and a real-world application.

## Features

### Passenger Features:
- **Sign Up/Login**: Passengers can register and log in using their phone number and OTP (One-Time Password).
- **Price Estimation**: Estimate the price of a ride based on the start and end points.
- **Ride Ordering**: Once the price is estimated, passengers can place a booking for a ride.
- **Payment Integration**: Integrated with **Alipay** for payment processing.

### Driver Features:
- **Driver Sign Up/Login**: Drivers can sign up and log in via phone number and OTP.
- **Ride Matching**: Drivers receive orders based on proximity and availability.
- **Order Status**: Track ride statuses (New, Dispatched, Accepted, In Progress, Completed).
- **Payment Request**: Drivers can request payment once the ride is completed.

### Admin (BOSS) Features:
- **User Management**: Admin can manage passengers, blacklist users, and resolve disputes.
- **Driver Management**: Admin can register drivers, verify driver credentials, and assign vehicles.
- **Vehicle Management**: Admin can manage vehicle information and statuses.

## System Architecture

The project follows a **microservices architecture**, which is divided into the following layers:

1. **Frontend Layer**:
    - Passenger App
    - Driver App
    - Admin Web Portal
    - WeChat Mini Program

2. **API Gateway Layer**:
    - Load balancing and request routing.

3. **Business Logic Layer**:
    - The core services handling passenger, driver, and admin operations.

4. **Capability Services Layer**:
    - Includes services for authentication, payment integration, and order management.

5. **Data Storage Layer**:
    - A centralized database for storing user, ride, and system data.

6. **Logging and Monitoring**:
    - For tracking system errors, application logs, and performance metrics.
